1. Add admin group and set gid=600

    # groupadd -g 600 admin

2. 

Configure the verification mode of your host account and the password as LDAP. And it
can ldapuser40. The password is set as "password". And the certificate login successfully
through
can be downloaded from http://ip/dir/ldap.crt. After the user logs on , the user has no host
directory unless you configure the autofs in the following questions.

    system-config-authentication
    ldap//instructor.example.com (In domain form, not write IP)
    OR
    # yum groupinstall directory-client (1.krb5-workstation 2.pam-krb5 3.sssd)
    # system-config-authentication
    LDAP
    dc=example,dc=com
    //instructor.example.com (In domain form, not write IP) 4.Download
    CA Certificate
    LDAP password
    6.Apply getent passwd ldapuser40

3.

Configure autofs to make sure after login successfully, it has the home directory autofs,
which is shared as /rhome/ldapuser40 at the ip: 172.24.40.10. and it also requires that,
other ldap users can use the home directory normally.

# systemctl enable --now autofs.service

# cd /etc/

# vim /etc/auto.master

/rhome /etc/auto.ldap

# cp auto.misc auto.ldap

# vim auto.ladp

autofs  -rw 192.168.1.2:/home/autofs

# systemctl restart autofs.service

# showmount -e 172.24.40.10 

# su - ladpuser40

4.
Create a 512M partition, make it as ext4 file system, mounted automatically under
/mnt/data and which take effect automatically at boot-start.

# fdisk /dev/vda
n
+512M
w
# partprobe /dev/vda
# mkfs -t ext4 /dev/vda5
# mkdir -p /data
# vim /etc/fstab
/dev/vda5 /data ext4 defaults 0 0 # mount -a

5.

Create a catalog under /home named admins. Its respective group is requested to be the
admin group. The group users could read and write, while other users are not allowed to
access it. The files created by users from the same group should also be the admin group.

# cd /home/
# mkdir admins /
# chown .admin admins/
# chmod 770 admins/ # chmod g+s admins/

 How to configure an NTP client on RHEL 8 / CentOS 8 Linux step by step instructions
In this section we will configure an NTP client to time sync with our new Chrony NTP server located on the 192.168.1.150 IP address:

    Install Chrony NTP package:

    # dnf install chrony

    Enable Chrony to start after boot:

    # systemctl enable chronyd

    Set Chrony to act as an NTP client

    To turn Chrony into the NTP cleint add the following line into the main Chrony /etc/chrony.conf configuration file. Change the IP address accordingly to point to your local Chrony NTP server:

    Server 192.168.1.150

    Restart Chrony NTP daemon to apply the changes:

    # systemctl restart chronyd

    Check for NTP server sources. Your local NTP server should be listed:

    # chronyc sources 
    210 Number of sources = 9
    MS Name/IP address         Stratum Poll Reach LastRx Last sample               
    ===============================================================================
    ^* rhel8.localdomain             3   6     7    36  -8235ns[-1042us] +/- 5523us

    By default the Chrony NTP client will perform a time synchronization in every 64 seconds.
    Check NTP client list on the NTP server:

    # chronyc clients
    Hostname                      NTP   Drop Int IntL Last     Cmd   Drop Int  Last
    ===============================================================================
    ntp-client.localdomain       7      0  10   -    48       0      0   -     -



7.



Create a volume group, and set 16M as a extends. And divided a volume group containing
50 extends on volume group lv, make it as ext4 file system, and mounted automatically
under /mnt/data.

# pvcreate /dev/sda7 /dev/sda8
# vgcreate -s 16M vg1 /dev/sda7 /dev/sda8
# lvcreate -l 50 -n lvm02
# mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg1/lvm02
# blkid /dev/vg1/lv1
# vim /etc/fstab
# mkdir -p /mnt/data
UUID=xxxxxxxx /mnt/data ext4 defaults 0 0
# vim /etc/fstab
# mount -a
# mount (Verify)
