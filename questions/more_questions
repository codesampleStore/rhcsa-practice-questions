Configure the verification mode of your host account and the password as LDAP. And it
can ldapuser40. The password is set as "password". And the certificate login successfully
through
can be downloaded from http://ip/dir/ldap.crt. After the user logs on , the user has no host

    system-config-authentication
    ldap//instructor.example.com (In domain form, not write IP)
    OR
    # yum groupinstall directory-client (1.krb5-workstation 2.pam-krb5 3.sssd)
    # system-config-authentication
    LDAP
    dc=example,dc=com
    //instructor.example.com (In domain form, not write IP) 4.Download
    CA Certificate
    LDAP password

Configure autofs to make sure after login successfully, it has the home directory autofs,
which is shared as /rhome/ldapuser40 at the ip: 172.24.40.10. and it also requires that,
other ldap users can use the home directory normally.

# systemctl enable --now autofs.service

# cd /etc/

# vim /etc/auto.master

/rhome /etc/auto.ldap

# cp auto.misc auto.ldap

# vim auto.ladp

autofs  -rw 192.168.1.2:/home/autofs

# systemctl restart autofs.service

# showmount -e 172.24.40.10 

# su - ladpuser40

4.
Create a 512M partition, make it as ext4 file system, mounted automatically under
/mnt/data and which take effect automatically at boot-start.

# fdisk /dev/vda
n
+512M
w
# partprobe /dev/vda
# mkfs -t ext4 /dev/vda5
# mkdir -p /data
# vim /etc/fstab
/dev/vda5 /data ext4 defaults 0 0 # mount -a

5.

Create a catalog under /home named admins. Its respective group is requested to be the
admin group. The group users could read and write, while other users are not allowed to
access it. The files created by users from the same group should also be the admin group.

# cd /home/
# mkdir admins /
# chown .admin admins/
# chmod 770 admins/ # chmod g+s admins/
