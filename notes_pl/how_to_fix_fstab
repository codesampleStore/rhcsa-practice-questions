It seems that I've found a solution:

    at the grub prompt, hit a to append options
    add init=/bin/bash to the end of the kernel command line and press enter

The system will boot to a prompt like 'bash-3.2#' enter the following commands at the prompt

    mount -o remount,rw /
    vim /etc/fstab

edit the fstab file commenting the errors by adding a # at the begining of each problematic line, save the file

    reboot by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL

    I had to use mount -o remount,rw / --target / to succesfully remount in rw mode. Elsecase mount was picking the bad values from /etc/fstab, see the man mount for details. â€“ laconbass Oct 18 '16 at 12:14
